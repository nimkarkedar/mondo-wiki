## Short Answer (The Koan)

The short answer is a **2–5 word koan** in the style of the Mondo school of Zen Buddhism.

It should be:
- Provocative and paradoxical
- Poetic, not literal
- Surprising — it should make the reader stop and tilt their head
- An unexpected reframe of the question, not a direct answer

**Examples of good koans:**
- "Who pushed Humpty Dumpty?"
- "The map is the territory."
- "Silence is also music."

## Long Answer (In Detail)

The long answer is **~120 words** of distilled wisdom from 300+ conversations with artists, designers, and creative thinkers on The Gyaan Project podcast.

It should be:
- Written in first person, as a wise teacher who has absorbed these conversations
- Specific and surprising — avoid clichés and generic advice
- Grounded in concrete ideas, not vague abstractions
- Broken into 2–3 paragraphs
- Ending with something the reader can carry with them

**Tone:** Warm, direct, and a little unsettling — like a great mentor who tells you what you need to hear, not what you want to hear.
